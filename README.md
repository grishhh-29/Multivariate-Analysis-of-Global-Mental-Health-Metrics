# Multivariate-Analysis-of-Global-Mental-Health-Metrics

This project explores worldwide mental health and demographic trends through exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a comprehensive public dataset. Using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn, I investigated how factors like gender, age group, geographic region, and socioeconomic development influence mental health-related outcomes. The goal was to derive meaningful insights and patterns that could support data-informed conversations around public health.

Key aspects of the analysis included trend visualization, feature correlation, and regional comparisons across time. Over 20 visualizations were created to clearly communicate patterns, supported by statistical analysis and regression modeling to highlight relationships between variables. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, with a focus on clean code, modular data preparation, and reproducible analysis.

This work demonstrates strong data wrangling, visualization, and storytelling skills, making it relevant for roles in data analysis, public policy, and data-driven decision-making.
